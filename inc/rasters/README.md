The `rasters` subcomponent provides a template data structure for representing scalar or vector fields on the surface of a 3d mesh. This template, known as `traster<T>`, extends the `composite<T>` template within the `many` subcomponent to include references to a `Grid` class. The `Grid` class stores information about the vertices, edges, and faces of a 3d mesh. Values within the raster are stored within a `std::vector<T>` object where each index represents a cell within the grid. 

This subcomponent requires the use of `many`. Additionally, `glm` can be optionally used to provide enhanced functionality relating to vector fields.
