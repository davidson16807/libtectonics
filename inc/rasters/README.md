The "rasters" library provides a data structure for representing scalar or vector fields on the surface of a 3d mesh. This data structure, known as "raster<T>", extends the "many<T>" class within the "composites" library to include references to a "Grid" class. The Grid class stores information about the vertices, edges, and faces of a 3d mesh. Values within the raster are stored within a std::vector<T> object where each index represents a cell within the grid.
