The `academics` subcomponent stores pure, "side-effect-free" utility functions that express simple scientific relationships (e.g. geometric relations, thermodynamics, orbital mechanics, etc.). Because these functions are so simple, they can be easily ported to other C-like languages. To take advantage of this opportunity, the `academics` subcomponent is written using macros to allow it to be used in C, C++, and GLSL. Experimental macro definitions also exist to port code to Javascript, however no guarantees are made as to the quality of output. 

No other libraries are required to use `academics`, however `glm` and `rasters` can be used in conjunction to provide enhanced functionality relating to linear algebra and vector calculus. Several libraries exist that implement the glm standard across a number of languages (glm, cglm, glm-js). Obviously, you do not need to use a library if you are using GLSL.
