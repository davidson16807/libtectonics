This folder contains unit tests. Every component that is incorporated into libtectonics goes through unit testing. Unit tests are made possible using the [catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) framework. Unit tests check for algabraic properties such as idempotence, associativity, or invertability, in addition to custom checks to ensure the code is able to reproduce basic facts about Earth or the other bodies in the solar sytem, to within at least an order of magnitude.
