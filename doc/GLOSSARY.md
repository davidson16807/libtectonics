**field** A field is an abstract concept that is approximated by rasters. It can be thought of as a map that has a value for every point in space. It can be approximated using a **raster**. The values stored may be numbers ("scalar field"), vectors ("vector field") or something else. 

**grid** A grid is a collection of interconnected grid cells that are intended to store values in a **raster**. It may be represented by an underlying **mesh** in which grid cells are represented by vertices, or there may be a more complex relationship, where a vertex in a mesh corresponds to several grid cells (see `LayeredGrid` for an example). A grid caches additional attributes that may be used when performing operations on rasters. These additional attributes are derived from vertices and faces. Another term for it may be a "mesh cache"

**mesh** A mesh is a collection of interconnected vertices. It is a tuple of vertices and faces. Vertices are stored as vec3s representing positions in a 3d cartesian coordinate system. Faces are stored as uvec3s representing the indices of vertices that are interconnected as a face within the mesh. A mesh is a simple data structure. It does not contain any additional attributes that are derived from vertices and faces. This is a job for **grid**

**raster** A raster is a collection of values that map to cells on a **grid**. It is an approximation of a mathematical **field**. The values stored may be numbers ("scalar raster"), vectors ("vector raster") or something else.
