This folder contains project documentation. In order to move at a fast pace, most documentation is comprised of notes that were written in sublime to collect my thoughts during the design of features. These notes including everything from an incomprehensible back-of-the-envelope calculation to a navel gazing treatise. Everything here is only meant as a rough draft, and while I try my best to correct logical errors, I make no attempt to correct spelling or grammar.

Some of the most important documents:

**ROADMAP.md**	A partial check list of features that need to be added to the library to reach minimum viable produce
**TESTS.md**	A partial check list of unit tests that need to be written
**GLOSSARY.md**	A glossary of formal terms used throughout the library and its documentation. Documentation elsewhere assumes familiarity with these terms.
