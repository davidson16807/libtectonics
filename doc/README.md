This folder contains project documentation. In order to move at a fast pace, most documentation is comprised of notes that were written in sublime to collect the developer's thoughts during the design of features. These notes can including anything from a hastily written TODO list or an incomprehensible back-of-the-envelope calculation to a extensive treatise. Everything here is only meant as a rough draft, and while I try my best to correct logical errors, I make no attempt to correct spelling or grammar.
