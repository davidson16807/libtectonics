# Memorizing the periodic table

We want a pragmatic approach to memorizing the periodic table.

We say "pragmatic" because we're not doing it for its own sake, 
and we're not doing it as some sort of weird flex to impress friends.
We want the things we memorize to have practical value.

We can still get to the point where we know the entire table, 
but if we do so we want it to be through an incremental approach
that starts simply with the most fundamental concepts and advances in later stages to lower priority trivia.
As is generally the case, concepts are best memorized by intuition, whereas trivia is best memorized by mneumonic tricks.
Again, this is an incremental approach, so at every stage along the way, where possible, 
we want the things we remember to best capture the essence of the entire table.

## Stage 1: group representatives 

The first stage almost certainly consists of memorizing the columns of the periodic table (known as "groups"),
since each group has its own dramatically unique behavior. 
Dramatic things are easy to remember, and memorizing all groups will likely best capture the essence of the table.
We can safely ignore the rows for now (or "periods") since behavior across them changes only in gradual ways.

Groups are abstract concepts, and abstract things are hard to memorize,
so we'll start off by memorizing one representative element for each group.

Which elements do we pick for our group representatives?
Well, we could pick the the first element of each group, 
but we find some representatives are... not very representative. 
For instance, beryllium is the first element of group 2, 
but we're much more likely to already know another element in that group: magnesium.
That's because beryllium occurs much less frequently on earth, and for that matter, the universe:

We all know that hydrogen and helium are the most abundant elements in the universe, 
but the abundances of the other elements are unappreciated facts that tell us a lot about the world around us.
Knowing the most abundant elements first will make it more likely for us to immediately apply our knowledge:
compounds of the most abundant elements will occur more frequently in the natural world,
and when we encounter such a compound whose elements are familiar, 
we'll have a much greater chance of knowing it well on first contact, as if it were an old friend. 
As a general principle, we'd like to start with memorizing the most abundant elements first.

Memorizing abundant elements first also makes it much easier to prioritize certain groups:

![https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(periodic_table)#/media/File:Periodic_table_blocks_spdf_(32_column).svg]

There are 32 groups in total, but the groups of the f and d blocks are much less distinct and much less abundant,
so as part of our first stage we really only need to know the group representatives for the s and p blocks

We presume you already know about hydrogen and helium, 
so to maximize the things we learn in a stage we won't use those as their group representatives.
Instead, let's start with the most abundant astronomical metals in the universe from the s and p blocks:

* Sodium
* Magnesium
* Aluminum
* Carbon
* Nitrogen
* Oxygen
* Chlorine
* Neon

Things are easiest to remember when they're concrete, common-place, lewd, violent, disgusting, hilarious, and/or dangerous.
So let's pick some mneumonics that fit those descriptions:

* **Sodium** salt shaker (common-place)
* **Magnesium** milk of magnesia (disgusting)
* **Aluminum** soda can (common-place)
* **Carbon** pencil (common-place)
* **Nitrogen** bag of poop (disgusting, hilarious)
* **Oxygen** fire (dangerous)
* **Chlorine** pool (common-place)
* **Neon** strip club sign (lewd)

Now we memorize the order. Picture a situation that combines each pair of mneumonics in order:

* **milk of magnesia in a salt shaker** it's an odd choice of seasoning
* **a soda can filled with milk of magnesia** it's an unpleasant surprise
* **a soda can that's been labeled with a pencil** it's easier now to tell there's milk of magnesia inside
* **a bag of poop that's labeled with a pencil** while we're busy labeling things...
* **a flaming bag of poop** if things weren't bad enough 
* **swimming pool filled with fire** sunburn is the least of your worries
* **swimming pool strip club** everyone's got their clothes off anyways
* **salt shaker at a strip club** they serve fries, too!

You can now see the most important parts of the table are, indeed, very easy to remember.

I toyed around with alternative mneumonics, for instance:

* **Oxygen** scuba tank (common-place)
* **Chlorine** chlorine gas (dangerous)

but I found the pairing mneumonics were much less hilarious.
If you find more memorable ideas than I did you're welcome to use those.
Don't forget that the act of making mneumonics is itself a good way to build memory.

# Stage 2: d block and period 2

If we want to memorize things in order of abundance, we'd be remiss not to memorize iron.
Iron is extremely common in the universe, more common even than some period 1 elements like sodium
It's also easily recognized, and serves as a good representative for the entire d block.
The reason iron is so common is because it acts as a trap in elemental synthesis: 
you can't do fusion or fission with it, so once it's created it has no where to go, and it slowly accumulates over time.

The mneumonic we choose for iron will be "sword": 
it's dangerous, it's very dynamic, and it pairs easily with other menumonics if you visualize it hitting things.

As a representative for the d-block we'll pair it with mneumonics for neighboring groups: magnesium and aluminum

* **a sword slicing a bottle of milk of magnesia in half** yeah! fuck that gross shit!
* **a sword slicing a soda can in half** probably because it had milk of magnesia in it

We still have more room to learn for this stage, so we'll also add the period 2 elements:

* **potassium** borat ("other countries have inferior potassium")
* **calcium** milk (common-place)
* **boron** roach bait (dangerous)
* **silicon** computer, cellphone, or calculator (common-place)
* **phosphorus** glow-in-the-dark dye (vivid)
* **sulphur** rotten eggs (disgusting)
* **flourine** toothpaste (common-place)
* **argon** welders (best fit, argon is used as a shielding gas for welding)

And mneumonic pairings:
* **milk carton that looks like borat** has a moustache and neon green mankini painted on it
* **roach bait mixed in your milk** the roaches love it
* **roach bait on your computer** not the best way to prevent software bugs
* **glow in the dark cellphone** easy to find
* **glow in the dark eggs** find your breakfast in the early morning!
* **toothpaste made from rotten eggs** the taste is terrible
* **a welder with bad teeth** he needs toothpaste

We should also start making mneumonic pairings with the elements of the previous period:
* **a novelty salt shaker that looks like borat** has a moustache and neon green mankini painted on it
* **milk carton filled with milk of magnesia** the taste is terrible
* **roach bait in a soda can** the roaches love it
* **pencil with a built in pocket calculator** pencils enter the modern age!
* **glow in the dark poop** this what happens when you drink glowsticks
* **rotten eggs on fire** the smell is terrible
* **swimming pool full of toothpaste** it's a little hard to swim
* **strip club full of nude dancing welders** horrifying

Here are some alternative mneumonics to consider:
* **potassium** banana (common-place)
* **boron** borax (common-place)
* **calcium** chalk
* **phosphorus** matches
* **sulphur** brimstone, hell
* **flourine** [this shit](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/02/23/things_i_wont_work_with_dioxygen_difluoride)

# Stage 3: Everything else you care about

Stage 3 consists of every other element you already probably care or know about, excluding the f-block

The Periodic Table of Mneumonics:

explanations:
* Lithium is the name of a song which Kurt Cobain performed
* Beryllium is often used in the magnetrons of microwaves 
* Iodine is best known for treating wounds
* Scandium is named after Scandanavia, which is historically known as the homeland of the vikings
* Vanadium is named after the Norse God fertility goddess Vanadis, described as a sexy lady
* Maganese shares the same etymology of Magnesium, so it borrows the same mneumonic
* Cobalt was named for the problems it caused in mining operations, which was often attributed to mischievous kobold creatures
* Gallium is solid at a room temperature, but melts in your hands, much like butter
* Germanium is named after germany, so picture a German ruler who's most memory. Probably either Otto Von Bismark, Wilhelm, or Hitler.
* Titanium is often used in the airframes of fighter jets
* Zinc is used in car batteries

pairings within period 3:
* **novelty microwave oven with kurt cobain's face on it**
* **butter in a microwave oven**
* **a stick of butter with a hitler moustache**
* **gazebo with a hitler moustache**
* **shampoo bottle shaped like a gazebo**
* **putting shampoo on a wound like its iodine**
* **wounded superman**
* **kurt kobain dressed up in a red cape and blue leotard**

pairings between periods 2 and 3:

# Supplement: atomic numbers
This is meant to be a supplement that can be used throughout each one of the stages

We're building off the technique described by Harry Lorrayne (see his book, "Super Power Memory")
Each of the digits correspond to a sound, which should become apparent if you're not already familiar:
